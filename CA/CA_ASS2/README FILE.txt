To compile and run the gem5 simulation with the provided code files, follow these steps:

Install gem5:
If you haven't already, you need to install gem5 on your system. You can follow the installation instructions on the gem5 website (https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building) to install gem5.

Organize Your Files:
Organize your code files in a directory. For simplicity, you can create a new directory, e.g., my_gem5_simulation, and place the following files in it:

vector_operations.hh (C++ header file)
vector_operations.cc (C++ source file)
vector_operations_script.py (Python configuration script)

Build gem5:
Open a terminal and navigate to the gem5 directory where you installed gem5. Build gem5 by running the following command:


scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j <number_of_cores>
Replace <number_of_cores> with the number of CPU cores you want to use for the build process. For example, if you want to use 4 cores, you can run:

scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j 4


Run the Simulation:

After gem5 is built successfully, you can run your simulation by executing the Python configuration script. In the terminal, navigate to the my_gem5_simulation directory where you placed your code files and run the simulation as follows:

./build/X86/gem5.opt vector_operations.py
Replace /path/to/gem5 with the actual path to your gem5 installation.

View Simulation Output:

The simulation will run, and you'll see the output in the terminal. It will print the simulation progress and vector operation such as 
VectorCrossProduct, NormalizeVector, and VectorSubtraction at different clock ticks .
VectorCrossProduct will be called at tick “150”. NormalizeVector will be called at tick “1500”. VectorSubtraction will be
called at tick “15000”.

operations such as::::

VectorCrossProduct will perform the cross-product of two vectors and print the value on the
command line. NormalizeVector will print the normalized vectors generated from two initial
vectors. VectorSubtraction will subtract two vectors and print the resultant vector on the
command line.
